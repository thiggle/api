#### Sentiment Analysis
Classify any text into sentiment classes. 

```json
{
  "prompt": "Is this a positive or negative review of Star Wars?
		The more one sees the main characters, the less appealing they become.
		Luke Skywalker is a whiner, Han Solo a sarcastic clod, Princess Leia a nag, and C-3PO just a drone.",
  "categories": ["positive", "negative"]
}
```
```json
{
  "choices": ["negative"]
}
```

Use any sentiment categories you like. For example, you could use `["positive", "neutral", "negative"]` or `["positive", "negative", "very positive", "very negative"]`. Or even `["happy", "sad", "angry", "surprised", "disgusted", "fearful"]`.
