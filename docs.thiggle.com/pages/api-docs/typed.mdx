#### Important

Type definitions in the **schema** must be exported. For example:

```typescript
export type BasicSentence {
  text: string;
}
```

**type_name** must be a valid type name in the **schema**. For example:

```typescript
export type BasicSentence {
  text: string;
}
```

In this case, `BasicSentence` is a valid **type_name**.

#### Example

```json
{
  "user_id": "a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-a1b2-c3d4e5f67890",
  "prompt": "Write a sentence",
  "max_tokens": 20,
  "temperature": 0.8,
  "top_p": 0.9,
  "stop": ["."],
  "presence_penalty": 0.6,
  "frequency_penalty": 0.5,
  "schema": "export type BasicSentence {
  text: string;
}",
  "type_name": "BasicSentence"
}
```
